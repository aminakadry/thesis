Prior to Debian 's release , the Softlanding Linux System ( SLS ) had been the first Linux distribution compiled from various software packages , and was a popular basis for other distributions in 1993-1994 . 	268
The Advanced Packaging Tool was deployed during this time and the first port to a non - Linux kernel , Debian GNU/Hurd , was started . 	312

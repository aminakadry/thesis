301	Perens decided to create a social contract for Debian , created a first draft , and edited suggestions from a month-long discussion on the Debian mailing lists into the Debian Social Contract and the Debian Free Software Guidelines , defining fundamental commitments for the development of the distribution . 
304	He broke apart the "base system" , the core packages of Debian , which had been maintained by Murdock alone , and distributed them to many maintainers . 
307	He created the BusyBox program to make it possible to run a Debian installer on a single floppy , and wrote a new installer . 
308	Perens was also responsible for many policy and design elements of Debian that persist to this day .Perens 
312	The Advanced Packaging Tool was deployed during this time and the first port to a non - Linux kernel , Debian GNU/Hurd , was started . 
313	The first Linux distribution based on Debian , namely Libranet , Corel Linux and Stormix 's Storm Linux , were started in 1999 .

328	The long release cycle employed by the Debian Project during this time drew considerable criticism from the free software community January 2012 , and this triggered the creation of Ubuntu in 2004 , to date one of the more influential Debian forks .

347	This release included the efforts of the Debian- Edu/ Skolelinux , Debian-Med and Debian- Accessibility sub-projects which raised the number of packages that were educational , had a medical affiliation , and ones made for people with disabilities . 
348	In 2006 , as a result of a much-publicized dispute , Mozilla software was rebranded in Debian , with Firefox becoming Iceweasel , Thunderbird becoming Icedove , along with other Mozilla programs . 
349	The Mozilla Corporation stated that Debian may not use the Firefox trademark if it distributes Firefox with modifications which have not been approved by the Mozilla Corporation . 
350	Two prominent reasons that Debian modifies the Firefox software are to change the artwork , and to provide security patches . 
351	Debian Free Software Guidelines consider Mozilla 's artwork non-free . 
352	Debian provides long term support for older versions of Firefox in the stable release , where Mozilla prefers that old versions are not supported .

507	2009-02-07 thumb300pxFlowchart of the life cycle of a Debian package Each Debian software package has a maintainer who keeps track of releases by the "upstream " authors of the software and ensures that the package is compliant with Debian Policy , coheres with the rest of the distribution , and meets the standards of quality of Debian .

514	2008-12-13 General Resolution : Endorse the concept of Debian Maintainers Debian Periodically , a package maintainer makes a release of a package by uploading it to the "incoming " directory of the Debian package archive ( or an "upload queue " which periodically batch-transmits packages to the incoming directory ) . 
515	Package uploads are automatically processed to ensure that they are well-formed ( all the requisite files are in place ) and that the package is digitally signed by a Debian developer using OpenPGP -compatible software . 
516	All Debian developers have individual cryptographic key pairs . 
520	2010-10-09 Debian Developer 's Reference Debian http ://www.debian 
523	2010-10-09 Debian Developer 's Reference Debian Packages are signed to be able to reject uploads from hostile outsiders to the project , and to permit accountability in the event that a package contains a serious bug , a violation of policy , or malicious code . 
527	For packages to become candidates for the next " stable " release of the Debian distribution , they first need to be included in the "testing " suite .

538	2008-11-24 Debian "testing " distribution Debian Thus , a release-critical bug in a package on which many packages depend , such as a shared library , may prevent many packages from entering the testing area , because that library is considered deficient . 
544	The Debian Project , being free software , handles security policy through public disclosure rather than through security through obscurity . 
545	Many advisories are coordinated with other free software vendors ( Debian is a member of vendor-sec ) and are published the same day a vulnerability is made public . 
546	Debian has a security audit team that reviews the archive looking for new or unfixed security bugs . 
547	Debian also participates in security standardization efforts : the Debian security advisories are compatible with the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures ( CVE ) dictionary , and Debian is represented in the Board of the Open Vulnerability and Assessment Language ( OVAL ) project .

628	The new freeze policy aims to provide better predictability of releases for users of the Debian distribution , and to allow Debian developers to do better long-term planning .

681	They contain packages that are either more modern than the ones found in stable or include packages that are not included in the Debian Project for a variety of reasons such as : e.g 
685	The Debian Project discourages the use of these repositories as they are not part of the project . 
686	Debian provides repositories of more than twenty nine thousand installable packages .

722	Depending on the architecture , it is possible to install Debian with as little as 20 MB RAM for s390 or 48 MB RAM for i386 and AMD64 . 
724	(embedded Debian ) improves installation to devices with minimal disk space , partially by removing documentation and installing only needed translations .

736	Many distributions use one of Debian 's branches as a base . 
737	Debian was ranked second only to Ubuntu ( which is derived from Debian ) for Most Used Linux Distribution for both personal and organizational use in a 2007 survey by Survey Monkey .com 
745	2008-11-02 Debian won the 2007 poll on Server Distribution of the Year by LinuxQuestions .org 
757	2008-11-02 Both the Debian distribution and their website have won various awards from different organizations .

768	Debian 2008-11-02 Debian has also received negative assessments . 
769	In May 2008 , a Debian Developer revealed his discovery that changes made in 2006 to the random number generator in the version of the openSSL package distributed with Debian and other Debian-based distributions such as Ubuntu or Knoppix , made a variety of security keys vulnerable to a random number generator attack .

774	DSA-1571-1 openssl : predictable random number generator 2008-10-31 Debian http ://cve .mitre 
782	The security weakness was caused by changes made to the openssl code by another Debian Developer in response to memory debugger warnings .

787	Debian OpenSSL Security Flaw 2008-10-31 2008-05-26 The security hole was soon patched by Debian and others , but the complete resolution procedure was cumbersome for users because it involved regenerating all affected keys , and it drew criticism to Debian 's practice of making Debian- specific changes to software . 
788	Richard Stallman and the Free Software Foundation ( FSF ) have criticized the Debian Project for providing the non-free repository , rather than excluding this type of software entirely , http ://www.gnu.org/philosophy/common-distros 
792	Explaining Why We Do n't Endorse Other Systems 2009-09-28 Free Software Foundation an opinion also echoed by some in Debian including the then - Project Leader Wichert Akkerman . 
801	Wichert Akkerman 1999-06-21 The internal dissent in the Debian Project regarding the non-free section has persisted , but the last time it came to a vote in 2006 , a large majority decided to keep it . 
804	General Resolution : Status of the non-free section 2009-09-28 Debian http ://www.debian 
806	General Resolution : Status of the non-free section 2009-09-28 Debian During the release cycles of Woody and Sarge , the Debian Project drew considerable criticism from the free software community because of the long time between stable releases . 
808	Ubuntu has releases every 6 months which are forks of Debian 's unstable distribution with bug fixes and other modifications . 
809	However , it may be more appropriate to compare Debian releases ( which continue to be supported after the release of subsequent versions ) to Ubuntu 's Long Term Support releases ( which are supported for five years for servers and also for five years for desktops starting with Ubuntu 12.04 
810	LTS ) ; Ubuntu Wiki : Ubuntu produces a new LTS release every two years , which is therefore similar to Debian 's new two-year release cycle for post- Debian 6.0 
812	When in need of updated versions of software , it is possible to use Debian testing instead of stable as it usually contains more modern , though slightly less stable packages . 
813	Another alternative is to use Debian backports , which are "recompiled packages from testing ( mostly ) and unstable ( in a few cases only , e.g 
815	security updates ) , so they will run without new libraries ( wherever it is possible ) on a stable Debian distribution " .

890	This repository is designed for Debian developers who participate in a project and need the latest libraries available , or for those who like to "live on the edge" , therefore it will not be as stable as the other distributions . 
898	Debian warns that these packages are likely unstable or buggy and are to be used at the user 's own risk . 
903	Debian recommends to update to the new stable once it has been released .

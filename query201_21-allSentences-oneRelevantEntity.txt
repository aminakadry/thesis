version of Debian was released in 1996 . 
Perens decided to create a social contract for Debian , created a first draft , and edited suggestions from a month-long discussion on the Debian mailing lists into the Debian Social Contract and the Debian Free Software Guidelines , defining fundamental commitments for the development of the distribution . 
He broke apart the "base system" , the core packages of Debian , which had been maintained by Murdock alone , and distributed them to many maintainers . 
He created the BusyBox program to make it possible to run a Debian installer on a single floppy , and wrote a new installer . 
Perens was also responsible for many policy and design elements of Debian that persist to this day .Perens 
The Advanced Packaging Tool was deployed during this time and the first port to a non - Linux kernel , Debian GNU/Hurd , was started . 
The first Linux distribution based on Debian , namely Libranet , Corel Linux and Stormix 's Storm Linux , were started in 1999 .

The long release cycle employed by the Debian Project during this time drew considerable criticism from the free software community January 2012 , and this triggered the creation of Ubuntu in 2004 , to date one of the more influential Debian forks .

Debian 2010-08-05 A new installer replaced the aging boot-floppies installer with a modular design . 
This release included the efforts of the Debian- Edu/ Skolelinux , Debian-Med and Debian- Accessibility sub-projects which raised the number of packages that were educational , had a medical affiliation , and ones made for people with disabilities . 
In 2006 , as a result of a much-publicized dispute , Mozilla software was rebranded in Debian , with Firefox becoming Iceweasel , Thunderbird becoming Icedove , along with other Mozilla programs . 
The Mozilla Corporation stated that Debian may not use the Firefox trademark if it distributes Firefox with modifications which have not been approved by the Mozilla Corporation . 
Two prominent reasons that Debian modifies the Firefox software are to change the artwork , and to provide security patches . 
Debian Free Software Guidelines consider Mozilla 's artwork non-free . 
Debian provides long term support for older versions of Firefox in the stable release , where Mozilla prefers that old versions are not supported .

Since updates to Debian software packages between official releases do not contain new features , some choose to use the testing and unstable distributions for their newer packages .

2009-02-07 thumb300pxFlowchart of the life cycle of a Debian package Each Debian software package has a maintainer who keeps track of releases by the "upstream " authors of the software and ensures that the package is compliant with Debian Policy , coheres with the rest of the distribution , and meets the standards of quality of Debian .

2008-12-13 General Resolution : Endorse the concept of Debian Maintainers Debian Periodically , a package maintainer makes a release of a package by uploading it to the "incoming " directory of the Debian package archive ( or an "upload queue " which periodically batch-transmits packages to the incoming directory ) . 
Package uploads are automatically processed to ensure that they are well-formed ( all the requisite files are in place ) and that the package is digitally signed by a Debian developer using OpenPGP -compatible software . 
All Debian developers have individual cryptographic key pairs . 
2010-10-09 Debian Developer 's Reference Debian http ://www.debian 
2010-10-09 Debian Developer 's Reference Debian Packages are signed to be able to reject uploads from hostile outsiders to the project , and to permit accountability in the event that a package contains a serious bug , a violation of policy , or malicious code . 
For packages to become candidates for the next " stable " release of the Debian distribution , they first need to be included in the "testing " suite .

2008-11-24 Debian "testing " distribution Debian Thus , a release-critical bug in a package on which many packages depend , such as a shared library , may prevent many packages from entering the testing area , because that library is considered deficient . 
The Debian Project , being free software , handles security policy through public disclosure rather than through security through obscurity . 
Many advisories are coordinated with other free software vendors ( Debian is a member of vendor-sec ) and are published the same day a vulnerability is made public . 
Debian has a security audit team that reviews the archive looking for new or unfixed security bugs . 
Debian also participates in security standardization efforts : the Debian security advisories are compatible with the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures ( CVE ) dictionary , and Debian is represented in the Board of the Open Vulnerability and Assessment Language ( OVAL ) project .

Time-based freezes are intended to allow the Debian Project to blend the predictability of time based releases with its policy of feature based releases . 
The new freeze policy aims to provide better predictability of releases for users of the Debian distribution , and to allow Debian developers to do better long-term planning . 
Debian developers expect that a two-year release cycle will give more time for disruptive changes , reducing inconveniences caused for users .

In May 2008 , a Debian Developer revealed his discovery that changes made in 2006 to the random number generator in the version of the openSSL package distributed with Debian and other Debian-based distributions such as Ubuntu or Knoppix , made a variety of security keys vulnerable to a random number generator attack .

Richard Stallman and the Free Software Foundation ( FSF ) have criticized the Debian Project for providing the non-free repository , rather than excluding this type of software entirely , http ://www.gnu.org/philosophy/common-distros 
Explaining Why We Do n't Endorse Other Systems 2009-09-28 Free Software Foundation an opinion also echoed by some in Debian including the then - Project Leader Wichert Akkerman . 
Wichert Akkerman 1999-06-21 The internal dissent in the Debian Project regarding the non-free section has persisted , but the last time it came to a vote in 2006 , a large majority decided to keep it .

General Resolution : Status of the non-free section 2009-09-28 Debian During the release cycles of Woody and Sarge , the Debian Project drew considerable criticism from the free software community because of the long time between stable releases . 
Ubuntu has releases every 6 months which are forks of Debian 's unstable distribution with bug fixes and other modifications . 
However , it may be more appropriate to compare Debian releases ( which continue to be supported after the release of subsequent versions ) to Ubuntu 's Long Term Support releases ( which are supported for five years for servers and also for five years for desktops starting with Ubuntu 12.04 
LTS ) ; Ubuntu Wiki : Ubuntu produces a new LTS release every two years , which is therefore similar to Debian 's new two-year release cycle for post- Debian 6.0 
When in need of updated versions of software , it is possible to use Debian testing instead of stable as it usually contains more modern , though slightly less stable packages . 
Another alternative is to use Debian backports , which are "recompiled packages from testing ( mostly ) and unstable ( in a few cases only , e.g 
security updates ) , so they will run without new libraries ( wherever it is possible ) on a stable Debian distribution " .

The Debian Social Contract defines a set of basic principles by which the project and its developers conduct affairs . 
The Debian Free Software Guidelines define the criteria for "free software " and thus what software is permissible in the distribution , as referenced in the Social Contract . 
The Debian Constitution describes the organizational structure for formal decision-making within the Project , and enumerates the powers and responsibilities of the Debian Project Leader , the Debian Project Secretary , and the Debian Developers generally .

Bits from the ( chilly ) release team A desire to contribute back to the free-software community ( practically all applicants are users of free software ) A desire to see some specific software task accomplished ( some view the Debian user community as a valuable testing or proving ground for new software ) A desire to make , or keep , free software competitive with proprietary alternatives A desire to work closely with people who share some of their aptitudes , interests , and goals ( there is a very strong sense of community within the Debian project which some applicants do not experience in their paid jobs ) A simple enjoyment of the iterative process of software development and maintenance It must have been in unstable for the appropriate length of time ( the exact duration depends on the "urgency " of the upload ) It must not have a greater number of "release-critical " bugs filed against it than the current version in testing .

Stable 's CDs and DVDs can be found in the Debian web site . 
Security updates for testing distribution are provided by Debian testing security team . 
Testing 's CDs and DVDs can be found on the Debian web site . 
This repository is designed for Debian developers who participate in a project and need the latest libraries available , or for those who like to "live on the edge" , therefore it will not be as stable as the other distributions . 
Debian warns that these packages are likely unstable or buggy and are to be used at the user 's own risk . 
Debian recommends to update to the new stable once it has been released .
